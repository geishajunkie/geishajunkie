- 👋 Hi, I’m @geishajunkie
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning quantum computing and the ability to connect an advanced LiDAR solution to a 5G quantum maglev network for clean energy transit and develop the quantum levitating network to help extract oceanic greenhouse gases/ methane from cyanobacteria "dead zones" into liquid natural gas (LNG). This deployable maglev humanitarian solution will allow people all over the world including small islands find the water and food they need.
- This "prosthetic" form of lightweight 3D printed polycarbonate and hempcrete terraformed maglev surfaces will help building structures around the world like Miami, Florida and Vinice, Italy will help support the structures near waterways or seashores develop a base structure for to keep floods from happening with water irrigation routes and plasma gasification recycling centers to use water as a form of hydrolysis for an immediate non-volitile source of hydrogen fuel or instant separation into liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to create clean H2O in any areas which are being threatened by flood forestfires, drought and supply areas of need with fresh water.
- These surfaces will work in colaboration with the NOAA, NOAA CRCP and EPA along with several govenment agencies become energy independant.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an OPenXR 
- platform based on IBM Q logic and create an
- advanced Navigation and advanced 5G network
- which is available to all quantum Maglev 
- and Quantum Levitation devices to live in
- a network which protects people from
- natural disasters and processes clean
- sources of water generated from filtered
- upper atmospheric water and clean
- burning LNG generated from a closed
- loop of sewage waste contained and
- safely harnessed inside ballistic 
- and static proof containment
- facilities which supplied an
- offset source of burning fuel
- for plasma gasification waste 
- to energy and noble gas recycling
- facilities all over the world.
- To help create a climate action
- alternative to waiting on
- governments to come up with
- no other alternative except
- for depopulation solutions
- like war, famine and generic
- xenobot/nanobot engineered
- pandemics.
